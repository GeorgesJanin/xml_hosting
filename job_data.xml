ABOUT THE JOB:

Google&apos;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change
how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one
another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend
well beyond web search. We&apos;re looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from
all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale
system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence,
natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is
growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project
critical to Google’s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as
you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be
versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new
problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.

As a Software Engineer, you will provide the infrastructure and application
programming interfaces (APIs) that enable distributed debugging and development
across Google, at a scale unmatched anywhere else. You will build the next
generation of debugging services that will transform debugging at Google and
make it easy to root cause events at large-scale, distributed systems in a
privacy-safe way. You will also build services that scale well and handle large
workloads, and will add minimum latency to clients and will be inexpensive to
operate.

The Core team builds the technical foundation behind Google’s flagship products.
We are owners and advocates for the underlying design elements, developer
platforms, product components, and infrastructure at Google. These are the
essential building blocks for excellent, safe, and coherent experiences for our
users and drive the pace of innovation for every developer. We look across
Google’s products to build central solutions, break down technical barriers and
strengthen existing systems. As the Core team, we have a mandate and a unique
opportunity to impact important technical decisions across the company.


RESPONSIBILITIES:

 * Solve problems around query latency, data freshness, index correctness and
   serving at scale.
 * Automate and improve efficiency in operational and user support.
 * Support users with system integrations and resolve client issues.
 * Participate in weekly onduty rotation to address user and operational
   tickets.
 * Collaborate with privacy to explore options for quick access to debug data
   while protecting users&apos; data.</description_text></item><item><id>1695455840</id><date_posted>2025-05-26T08:39:15</date_posted><date_created>2025-05-26T09:11:10.386824</date_created><title>Software Engineer I </title><organization>Talkdesk 2</organization><organization_url></organization_url><date_validthrough></date_validthrough><locations_raw><item><key name="@type">Place</key><name>Porto</name><address><key name="@type">PostalAddress</key><name>Porto</name><addressCountry></addressCountry><addressLocality>Porto</addressLocality></address></item></locations_raw><locations_alt_raw></locations_alt_raw><location_type></location_type><location_requirements_raw></location_requirements_raw><salary_raw></salary_raw><employment_type></employment_type><url>https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/talkdesk2/jobs/6903767</url><source_type>ats</source_type><source>greenhouse</source><source_domain>job-boards.greenhouse.io</source_domain><organization_logo></organization_logo><cities_derived><item>Porto Alegre</item></cities_derived><regions_derived><item>Rio Grande do Sul</item></regions_derived><countries_derived><item>Brazil</item></countries_derived><locations_derived><item>Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil</item></locations_derived><timezones_derived><item>America/Sao_Paulo</item></timezones_derived><lats_derived><item>-30.0331</item></lats_derived><lngs_derived><item>-51.23</item></lngs_derived><remote_derived>false</remote_derived><description_text>At Talkdesk, we are courageous innovators focused on redefining the customer experience, making the impossible possible for companies globally.

The team has skilled full-stack engineers who collaborate closely to tackle challenging problems. We foster a supportive and hands-on environment where everyone contributes to designing and building secure, scalable solutions.
Our team thrives on collaboration, innovation, and a shared commitment to standardizing our solutions across all company products in a secure and efficient way.

Be fully onboarded to your new team, familiarizing yourself with Clutch’s tools, processes, and culture.
Build strong relationships with your team members, leader, and cross-functional stakeholders.
Work in collaboration with developers and other stakeholders to enhance our platform.
Within 6 months, you will:
Ensure high-quality code and enable the efficient delivery of features and improvements.
Write elegant, efficient, and testable code that is easy to maintain and debug.
Take care of the configurations and processes documentation so stakeholders understand how to use the platform.
Within 9 months, you will:
As a true teammate, continuously improve the team’s processes, brainstorm ideas, and communicate statuses, and progress
Deliver a lot of new stuff to our products
Start identifying opportunities to deliver faster, reliable solutions and make initial contributions to architectural improvements.
What You’ll Bring
7+ years as a Software Engineer in a fast-paced environment, preferably in SaaS and/or Fintech
Proficiency in frontend technologies, preferably TypeScript and React.
Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to write clean, maintainable code.
You must have excellent English communication
Ability to work collaboratively in a remote-first environment.
Please note that this role may evolve as our business needs change, so we appreciate your flexibility and adaptability.
What’s In It For You?
Remote Flexibility: Enjoy the freedom of remote work from anywhere, balancing life and career seamlessly.
Unforgettable Off-Sites: Twice a year, bond with colleagues in exciting destinations, fostering teamwork and fresh ideas.
Paid Time Off and National Holidays: Enjoy 20 PTO days yearly and the National Holidays for relaxation and rejuvenation.
Stock Options: Joining us means having a stake in our success, so you&apos;ll receive stock options as part of your compensation package.
Home Office Setup: Create your ideal workspace with a dedicated budget for home office essentials.
Work Trip Budget: Grow personally and professionally with a budget for work-related trips and co-working.
About Us
Clutch is a revolutionary vertical SaaS company, proudly backed by Andreessen Horowitz (A16z), aimed at revolutionizing the way Credit Unions engage and change the lives of their members. As a champion of financial well-being, we address the urgent need for affordable lending solutions in an era where the average American grapples with over $155,000 in household debt.

Learn about TRM Speed in this position:
The team was tasked to deliver a critical project. Initial estimates were that it would take 2 months; By ruthlessly prioritizing, and bringing more resources to help with implementation, and iterating with the Product team to descope features from our milestone 1, we were able to deliver within two weeks and continue to iterate on the rest of the milestones. The project was able to deliver immediate value in sales conversations.
During project execution, engineers often have questions for their design and product counterparts. This back and forth could take hours or days to get everyone on the same page, but at TRM we short circuit that by ensuring that engineers feel empowered to also drive decision-making across product and design. We analyze the issue and propose solutions and are able to drive the discussion forward and build alignment much faster.
We have a large group of power users internal to the company who provide us with product feedback. When our engineering team hears of a pain point from this group, they’re empowered to ship these minor improvements directly to this group without seeking multiple levels of approval.
